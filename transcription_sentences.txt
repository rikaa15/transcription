he loses man what
 you're fuck dude fuck if you lose some fuck
 it
 you can't just be like yeah I'm like how long do you think my prison sentence is gonna be today
 well I see my children I don't know just like you can say well yeah I maxed out to him but you know I get you
 no no and I've been trashing falling on stuff oh well under the Kamala pup medical you know but the machine that the combo represents
 yeah she's irrelevant I mean she's not even know not like I made a joke which I realize I deleted which is like nobody's even bothering to try to kill Kamala because pointless what do you achieve it's just
 it's no point in true though nobody's trying to kill Joe Biden it's
 you actually put that up
 yeah know some people interpreted as though as calling for people to of course that's later but but I was like but I was like no even you know like doesn't seem strange that no one's even bother it's right
 it's not worth it I mean there's an endless supply and like nobody would it's absurd it could be anybody yeah yeah you know he's gonna try to let me try this assassinated puppet of course not a marionette yeah marionette it's just like
 you know it's hilarious what she's safe like I like to try to kill Trump twice with actual guns and bullets yeah right fucking Butler I was and he doesn't seem rattled it's weird
 does he do you didn't see what rattled
 he's I mean he's the constitution of an ox it's
 you know it's not like working out and eating healthy and he's okay we're gonna take this oh good so he's not like let me know another salad no or work out you know fastidiously that's
 he I feel like he just didn't work out and he eats you know
 she's Burgers not Coke and stuff and because it's just I think it just inherently has a strong Constitution
 so in use I mean you're just with him he didn't seem like a man who'd been the subject of two assassination attempts know he seemed of you know Sound Mind Body and strong wrap bone
 did you I mean that's what I said and the thing which yeah but the Rocks I made there were impromptu there's no teleprompter or anything
 I just I was just speaking extemporaneously
 are you the only right now like a media consultant I mean yeah no I've noticed I was I mean no I just
 no I just thought about what I want to say and I just spoke with the cuff drunk nothing
 good for you yeah
 I could look like now I'm just talking look at me wow amazing I can't even believe it I can talk with that's crazy but if he loses its gonna be hard for you to pretend you never supported him
 oh in the deep end yeah no you are definitely the Jeep and you touch bottom know I'm like I'm like rolling around like a pig and I'm like all in baby is it fun yes we're fun
 how I mean there may be some in the hopefully unlikely event that he loses they may be some a Vengeance on me were you kidding I don't mean it's possible it's possible you've got to be one of the biggest government contractors
 we do essential work for the government yes yeah so like you know
 we do useful essential work that we compete for and win contracts on because our product is much better alright class less
 that's why we get and and I mean take for example the the NASCAR to transportational to and from the space station Boeing got NASA ordered two contracts at the start one to Boeing and want to SpaceX Boeing was awarded twice as much as SpaceX
 SpaceX has done all the national transport
 from the space station and and Boeing is only done one to one transport of one of two astronauts to the space station and we had to bring him back
 going to twice as much as SpaceX
 there's this a total misunderstanding that my companies have been subsidized and supported by the government and get all these and it's like do you really think that a Biden Administration is going to subsidize me kidding
 no in fact they take away every contract they possibly can so for example there was the FC the FCC contract to
 42 billion dollars for providing providing rural Broadband yes okay
 we we actually first look we don't we think there shouldn't be any subsidies so we recommend us that this program just not exist but since you're insisting that it exists we will compete and we have better products so we won I don't know about a quarter of it
 which would have included the devastated areas like North Carolina and so and the FCC took it away
 illegally they just bought it three out of five Commissioners voted away and said even though you want it we're sending it
 on what did you know how many people they have connected how many zero
 so you think that was political
 well the three Democrats voted against two Republicans voted for it so you tried to get started you try to get started into North Carolina into Western North Carolina the areas devastated by the hurricane we have it is it is in there and it is the primary means of communication in the devastated areas
 you had conflict with Buddha judge over this
 well I raise the cons I said look we're we had delivered
 we've been delivering stalling terminals there for a while and I was some people already had them since that you know private individuals had Starling their already we delivered a really and got all the way up to the you know the areas where they would let us go any further and then we're like okay we're going to send helicopters in and and find people who are stranded and give them starlink terminals
 so I think is you know a nice thing yeah okay
 the
 they they wouldn't let us land
 because there was an FAA notice to M and notam that said it in order to land you have to know who you're going to meet with to land
 now the problem is we're trying to deliver internet communications people don't have internet communications we don't know who they are then they can't reach us because they don't have communications do you see the cash 20 yes I do and saying so it's obviously impossible for people who don't have internet communications to let us to let us know who they are because they don't have the internet yes yes and so
 did you explain this to the federal government yes what they say they fixed it
 how was Buddha judge when you talk to him he was actually good so I want to be just yeah yeah I want to put a judge some credit here first a you know when a complain about it he
 reacted in a very level-headed way and he reached out to me a cold me yeah and we're discussed the issue got the bond of it and he fixed it good so credit judge yeah well into you for pushing it yeah I mean so but as soon as he was aware of the problem he fixed it
 will you publicized it too yeah as soon as you shamed him well but I do want to give credit words to ya know amen I agree completely so but back to the original question
 you know about the potential consequences if
 you know having gone all in this doesn't work yeah I mean you had to have thought about this long and hard before you did it what was your thinking
 I mean yeah so
 it might be is is that
 if Trump doesn't win this election it's the last election we're going to have
 that
 the
 Democrats the demo machine
 has been importing so many people bringing in so many illegals flying flying in with us like CVP boarder app thing that nobody even near about like secret program that's illegal it's illegal but there's no action to actually to stop it from happening
 there
 transporting
 large numbers of illegals to swing States
 if you look at the numbers these are the numbers from the government website so it's like from the Democrat administered government websites like where do you get this data from the government website that is run by democrats
 and there are triple digit increases in illegals to all the swing States and in some cases it's like 700% over the last three years
 these swing state margins are sometimes 10 2000 boats
 so what happens if you put
 you know hundreds of thousands of people
 into each swing saved
 and and for these for these when somebody is granted a sign on they are fast tracked that they
 get a green card and then five years after the green card
 they can just they can get citizenship and they can fully legally vote
 and when they do so they report a womanly Democrat
 and some of the bottle of like well
 a lot of them their social values don't align with sort of the Fall left sort of woke ideology so that's true but
 um but that's not the top priority the top priority is getting their friends and family also to the United States and that the dams also issue all these programs these sort of handouts essentially that make them beholden to the Democratic party
 so they vote down
 that's what happens
 so my prediction is if there's another four years of a damn Administration they will legalize so many illegals that are there that the next election there won't be any swing States
 and we'll be a single party
 country just like California is a single party state
 that's a super majority demo state in California because of immigration yes the California was
 fairly reliably Republican Bill Clinton lost California 92 and 11 West Virginia
 yes so there was a 1986 amnesty yes
 and
 thereafter California trying to very strongly damn and is at this point I think
 6570 per cent something like that it's super majority don't like the California legislature yes there's more than two thirds Democrat
 he has it improved the state know
 it's it's not and they California just passed which is shocking it's hard to believe it's even this is even real
 but California just passed a law making it illegal to require voter ID in any election at all in California
 you know that no yeah new sometimes into lower last week it's illegal to require an ID and any election even a Town Council
 and a friend of mine who was this can he lives in Palo Alto was like it was like is this actually real anywhere so I put in like some City Council election
 try to show them his ID and they said we're not even allowed to look at your ID
 have this extended this same what's going on right now but the proud of it they're not hiding it but it's only voting it's not buying a gun or buying liquor buying pack cigarettes or flying on an airplane or renting a hotel room it's only voting that it's a little if you tried by a gun I mean they're gonna ID you six ways to Sunday yeah they tried California trying to make basically equals owner gun
 and the same people that demanded vaccine IDs for if you want to travel or do anything on the same ones who say no voter ID is required is there any reason obviously have a critical to pass a law like that except to a bet voter fraud
 it's for it's it's so that fraud can never cannot be proven
 so it enables large-scale fraud and no way to prove it because how would you prove it it's literally impossible
 no idea you're not even allowed to show you right
 it's insane well it is insane insane
 so
 yeah
 the purpose of no idea is obviously to conduct fraud in elections
 obviously
 there can be no other explanation I mean they come up with some nice sounding thing people don't have IDs could you live in this country without ID yeah I mean they're common revelers like it's racist to require ID
 and which is insane I think it's actually raced racist and paid to say that people can't figure out how to get ID
 how could you live here without an idea I don't think it's even you can't yeah you can't do anything
 yeah
 you got any idea for everything like a list of the things you need ID for is basically everything
 except voting
 so
 so you see the rest of the total bulshit obviously come obviously yes
 but that doesn't in any way minimize the aggression or self-righteousness they bring to this conversation
 yes you're a racist if you want that right where is that in fact obviously someone is racist if they say that people have particular race cannot get ID
 that's patronizing and racist that's absurd yes
 yeah
 yes like what a governor of New York said people in the you know get don't know how to use computers or something like that I mean like you know super out of touch
 for sure yeah
 so it's like so there's a really clear temperature she doesn't know how to use computers but they do obviously I don't think how cool could use a computer qualified an electrically yeah no but not everyone in New York is done is Kathy Oakley I think that's true yeah so you see the other 49 states becoming California if
 the machine wins well you don't need all 49 to go that way you just need you know enough to have the election have their not be swing States I mean there are only six weeks swing States yep so there are only six states out of 50 right now that are in contention
 so if those six states that are in contention
 by narrow margins are no longer in contention
 then the only contest will be who once the Democratic primary
 that's how it is in California that's how it is in New York
 there's no there's no
 party party versus party situation
 the only contest is who once the Democratic primary
 and as we've seen with the
 appointment of Kamala who no one voted for even in the Democratic primary yes where's the Democracy here
 which is easier though I mean it's just that the party leaders just decides who is in charge
 that's that that's that's a you know tiny oligarchy basically
 comprised of the national democracy the richest people in the country that's kind of the interesting part to me is that the richest people in the country are on board with this I mean that's what it is it's the it's a collection billionaire most of them are yeah but you're not know me and not everyone is I think there's
 but it is a shocking number of
 circle billionaires are in the Dem Camp what more than are in the Republican oh for sure which is wild so the
 in fact the astonishing thing in the swing States is that that they're even a contest given that the dams have far more money than the Republicans so the color came dramatically outspend the Trump campaign in the spring States the
 only
 the media is overwhelmingly pro Democrat
 so you've got you know the Press you know is it a damn Squad and
 you know so
 and then you've got all the almost all the Hollywood and entertainment this celebrities also you know endorsing command and being programmed so you got this celebrities you got the they got the money they got it basically everything on the side of the dams the Republicans Underdog here Trump's Underdog and swing States and still it's a contentious it's still 50 50 after all that
 what does that tell you
 it tells me that if people actually knew what was going on there weren't being fed non-stop propaganda it would be a landslide in favor of Republicans yeah
 well how's this for crazy has there ever been a more volatile time in American politics not in our lifetimes No One Alive has ever seen anything like this
 but long before things started to really fall apart the Heritage Foundation saw it coming Heritage is pulled together a coalition of over 100 right-leaning groups to develop a comprehensive plan for day one that would include detailed policy proposals on most pressing issues the big ones securing the Border controling inflation cracking down on Election fraud protecting the rights of the individual and saving the nation from being crushed by woke anti-human ideology
 the team and Heritage is also developed a plane to dismantle the Deep state that keeps this nonsense going and reclaim this nation from the small group of technocrats that's broken every thing
 Heritage also running a training and vetting program to identify effective conservatives to serve in the next Presidential Administration people who will share your values this country's values and actually do the job it can't just be the same pool of discredited people from Washington populating every Administration
 Heritage has a Long Head Start and put in a lot of work already but they need your support to finish the job and to support the incoming president
 you can go to heritage.org slash Tucker and contribute to this important work today a lot depends on it Heritage dot org slash Tucker
 but why not join the easier side I mean you're just you're creating problems for yourself by getting on stage with Trump and I mean you must have had friends who said that to you
 sure yes yeah people care about you like why even getting involved in this
 well okay because I think we want to remain a democracy and we don't want to become a one-party state
 yes that's the reason and the it's exactly the people call trumpets Richard Munger see it's the people who are saying Trump's a threat to democracy others the threat to democracy yes one party rule is not democracy one party where essentially party Elite pick a candidate as happened with Kamala it's not democracy where did the people vote show me where the people voted
 no people voting there's all just damp party Elite that just appointed someone
 and and when the when the Biden puppet we're providing puppets ratings sagged they knocked him in the back immediately just tossed him out
 and put it put a new puppet on
 that's exactly what happened tell me I'm wrong
 well not only you write I mean it's almost not even worth criticizing Kamala Harris know exactly what does she have to do with it there's no point in criticizing it comes she's simply the face of a lot of a much larger machine yes and she will say whatever is whatever whatever the teleprompter whatever's on the teleport is going to say it yes she gets stuck if the teleprompter breaks that happened recently I think the problem is told she just she just like looping for a while for about a minute
 so thank you watch but she'll just say whatever words or on teleprompter so you know
 it's really whoever controls teleprompter is the actual so those that's who's actually in charge and who is that two think well I've tried putting it down it's not like
 anyone kind of Mastermind it's like it seems to be it's like come on us sort of a marionette with
 you know about a thousand profit Masters type of thing
 like not it's it's
 or maybe it's in it's somewhere north of 100 is what it seems like yes I bet you know 80 of them
 I probably know most of them yeah yeah
 so I mean just by virtue of your job and what you've been doing for the last 30 years I mean yeah
 um and I should say I think you voted I like to see a matchup of those called the top 100 puppet Master's in the afternoon Client List
 you think there's some overall overlap its strong overlap when are we going to see that list do you think I don't know it's it's mind blowing that that they have not tried to prosecute even one
 not even the worst offender on the F10 Client List they have not even tried to prosecute even one that's insane
 because they have a lot of diabetic grandmothers who were outside the Capitol in January 6th they're kind of occupied yeah I mean they put like whatever
 5 or 600 January 6th
 protesters and prison and not one person on the Epson Client List
 will that ever come out do you think
 you know I think part of why Kamala is getting so much support is that if Trump wins that FC and Client List is going to become public yes
 and some of those billionaires behind Kamala are terrified of that outcome yeah do you think Reid Hoffman's uncomfortable yes yeah
 and Gates and Gates yeah
 and I only asked that because you can certainly just look at them and you're like that that's enormous person right there I don't know I mean I assume you know them yeah yeah I read Hoffman was my vice president was development of PayPal yeah 20 four years ago
 he does he seemed nervous to you
 yeah I mean he's terrified of a trump victory
 because of this closure that would follow
 I think
 yeah I mean I think he's so certainly ideologically in a line with Trump anyway
 but I think he is concerned about the
 fancy situation
 like something might actually the doj might actually move forward
 there are a lot of videos apparently those rooms on the island and I think out in New Mexico were wired for video right and where's the video I mean between Diddy and Epstein
 it's good this was probably several thousand hours of footage here yeah yeah
 where did the people on those videos are lecturing the rest of us but our moral failings isn't it yes we're what is that
 well I mean part of how they deflect attention from themselves is by March you know criticizing the morals of others yes so they sort of like a preemptive moral strike
 I mean as I said I think those who are saying Trump is a threat to democracy are themselves actually the threat to democracy
 feels like we're getting to a place where the rest of us know too much
 is this you know what I mean I mean it's it's easier to live in a society we don't really know what people in charge are doing or why they're doing it but now thanks I would say largely to X yeah I think that's fair to say that yeah we do know a lot not everything but we know a lot and I wonder where does that look what happens next now we know all this the kidnapper showing us his face like what happens
 well
 I think if Trump wins we can
 do some house cleaning
 and shed light on things
 yeah all the X platform does is adhered to freedoms freedom of speech within the bounds the law yes and if people want to change the laws they can change the laws and so like X in different countries that we exit does sensor in countries where censorship is
 is low we don't try to you know put push American laws and other countries but we do try to stick to the law in any given country that's what we're doing
 we open source our algorithm
 we try to be as transparent as possible
 but those who want to push lies of say hate truth and transparency yes because it shows them to be Liars
 I mean you look at that like how outrageous it was that
 Kamala in the presidential debate kept pushing the fine people hooks they know the fine people hoax is false
 Trump would never support Nazis in Nazi it's absurd and he explicitly said that you in that same speech that was condemned not you know anyone who is Nazi Tendencies with the strongest possible times
 um and yet
 despite knowing that to be false the people who wrote the speech for the Kamala puppet I put the fine people hoax in the presidential debate
 deliberately lying
 again
 mess up
 if she wins I mean I how can they let X continue
 in its current
 form in its current role in American society that they won't they will try to shut it down by any means possible
 what do you mean by any means possible
 I mean with you either by
 I mean I'll try passed laws they'll try to prosecute the company prosecute me any
 I mean the amount of low-fat that we see taking place is outrageous
 I mean the
 I mean many examples but like the Department of Justice For example launched a huge lawsuit against SpaceX
 will failing to hire a sign of seekers
 come on
 the Asylum Seekers Asylum not Asylum those events granted Asylum Seekers now this now there's also a law called International traffic and arms regulations that because SpaceX develops Advanced missile technology that can be used in nuclear icbms
 that we have we have to be very careful with who we hire we can only hire someone if they were permanent resident or citizen that's what the Italo says
 then there's another law that says that you cannot discriminate against Asylum Seekers
 so
 we're down if you do down if you don't
 but doj did a massive lawsuit against SpaceX
 willing to hire someone Seekers even though we are it is illegal for us to how to hire someone so you guys under Italy
 this is actual thing that that's going on
 and they can only they can only do a fairly small number of lawsuits every year so why did they pick this one
 because look next yeah for
 I mean it's like that famous quote from barrier you know the yeah Stalin's Like Chief torturer and head of the secret police
 various said show me the man and I'll show you the crime exactly
 I mean we have so many laws that it is actually impossible to
 you know impossible to do business but impossible to operate without
 being planning some law because you have laws like the ones I just get gave you without we're both things are illegal yes the contradicted one another they contradict one another
 so you know it's illegal to
 discriminate against like you just grenade against silence Seekers and jobs but it's also legal for us to hire something Seekers
 really just chose one they chose the the one law and ignore the other one and that department of justice that Federal level prosecutors basics for that
 what do you think Matt
 well she just credits the idea of law which some of us wants to take seriously absolutely it this affects both the perception at of American Justice and the reality of it yes so
 no I'm actually a big fan of the American justice system and I think on balance
 you know we've got
 a little still have an excellent judicial system so that judges that care about the letter and intent of the law I mean not just the letter but also the intent of the last
 but something that people should be concerned about is that there's an increasing movement to place activists as judges
 this is
 if you look at who did the
 Biden Administration confirm as federal judges and who have
 been confirmed at the state level in sort of States increasingly it is it is not
 judges who
 care about Justice or he's already care about
 following the law they care about
 social justice not justice justice right what they call social justice activists as judges you got a real problem
 do you think if that continues
 will not have a real justice system or a real country I mean yeah
 but again
 your purchase of access been I think it's fair to say even if I hated it I would say this because it's true it's been pivotal in American politics yeah in an American society
 do you think they could shut you down if the Democrats continue to hold power though I quickly try yeah yeah
 and if they if they
 if they get a majority in the Senate and House
 and the presidency then they can simply pass a little
 and delete section 230
 so someone make us liable for any what anyone says on a platform with
 you know go like at this point almost 600 million monthly active users yeah
 which is impossible you know that's that's like trying to regulate speech and
 city of like a country so a big country yeah just be instantly ranked
 but I bet they wouldn't withdraw a legal immunity from the vaccine makers at the same time would they know
 oh that's unlikely
 just I mean as long as we're with throwing legal liability protection
 yeah I mean the whole vaccine debate is a long one
 you know I'm not actually I'm not anti-vaccine in general
 I think we want to
 exercise caution with use of vaccines but in the absence of vaccines there'll be a lot more I think
 people that have died
 you know like we want the smallpox vaccine that one it seems a good one yeah yeah I spoke box will kill you
 killed a lot of people a lot of people
 it used to be people would like
 a lot of people would die of smallpox and a lot of people get polio
 for sure yeah
 the presidential
 oh yeah there's still people you meet people today yeah in their 80s who limping from childhood polio right it's good that we don't have that and vaccines you know played a major role in that
 so that doesn't mean they're fixing should not have any scrutiny of course they should we should be making sure that the quality control and vaccines is incredibly good
 guess what you're giving them to children and whatnot and we didn't we shouldn't force people to take back seats
 um that itself is a controversial statement that we shouldn't force people fishing reports we will take vaccines now yeah
 so just to react I believe in Freedom like yeah I've noticed like you know America's supposed to be land Liberty
 you know
 freedom and so that we try to as much as possible maximize people's individual liberty and that we try to be a country where you succeed based on your talent and hard work yes
 those are two fundamental values
 that that's what that's what made America great and if we lose those we will
 outline will be Swift
 what what do you if you had to get it if you had to bet
 I mean does
 freedom reassert itself in America
 or not
 well that's why I think part of why this election is so pivotal I think if we
 with a trump Administration
 I think we can
 improve the levity of Americans we can
 I think we need to have sensible deregulation where we keep the regulations that mattered like we don't want to destroy you know
 very important habitats or yes you know encourage oil spills or anything like that but there are so many regulatory agencies that have overlapping responsibility that we are smothering progress
 and we can't build a high-speed rail in America look at the ridiculous High-Speed Rail Project in California where they've spent seven billion dollars and older got to show for it is 61600 foot section of concrete with no rails on it
 the picture of an online
 so it's not that fast yet we wouldn't say it's high speed at this point or even rail it doesn't even have a baby by now that but it's this comically small section of rail
 so 7 billion dollars has been spent most of it and like environmental Consulting and
 I don't know where but clearly not in building High-Speed Rail so we can't we've got
 there are so many different Regulatory Agencies and so many
 laws and regulations that prevent progress that if those continues we simply won't be able to get anything done
 it does seem like the engineers are not getting rich it's the environmental Consultants the climate Consultants the Dei Consultants a whole consultant class seems to be getting richer by the year or people with actual skills the ones that bring actual progress useful things products and services that useful can use that's right yeah so this is a thing that if you're like traveling at a desert island you'd want those people right but you wouldn't want environmental Consultants okay yeah yeah and it's like who's who actual builders that get things done
 and you know and and every year we're making it hotter in America for actual Builders to get things done
 you know we're in this like weird and Rand Atlas rugged scenario
 where is you know this yet another regulation yet another Rule and the sort of that that phrase and Atlas Rock oh you'll manage oh you'll manage or you'll manage it's like eventually like can't get anything done why the house still toward people with
 with meaningful skills it's not it's not a neutral posture they have and they're riching themselves obviously by creating fake jobs because they have no skills
 and you know they don't have creative power so I understand that but why do they hate people who do have creative power in actual skills
 I don't understand that
 I'm not sure I understand it either because it's difficult for me to put myself into mindset
 because I'm sort of beliefs in construction I build things that's what I do yeah but cars about Rockets I will satellite internet
 you know I've spent
 thousands of hours tens of thousands of hours in factories building up factories
 so
 you know I was like I can't really put myself in the mind of say someone who would want to do crime because I don't want to cry yeah you know I don't want to hurt you know this over who
 enjoy hurting other people I don't enjoy hurting other people so I have a hard time
 imagining why would somebody do that yes you know in an extreme case
 you can't put yourself in the mind of like say Jeffrey Dahmer where you're like a cannibalistic serial killer because you're not a catalyst serial killer right and like I can't get I don't get it
 you know it's not a fetish you can relate to hot
 you know
 I do think this is that in the sort of well-meaning sort of liberal mindset I know I have many good friends who
 have you they're very they have deep empathy for their fellow human being good and they care
 and and but the challenge that they have is that they've often grown up in a very sheltered existence where everyone around them is nice and so blind and they just really don't encounter people who are have
 uncontrolled violent tendencies or or like hurting people
 you know they're just always growing up in a sort of Kumbaya yeah everyone is nice
 if you communicate situation Minneapolis prey it's yeah
 yeah I mean
 if yeah but there's a small number of people it's like a few percent of society that either can't have
 anger management issues that are so severe that they lose their temper and
 hurt or murder others and there's a small it's like it's not a large number that that enjoy hurting other people and if you do not incarcerate them they will they will do that they will hurt other people
 and what I see is what I call
 shallow empathy like people have empathy for the criminals but not empathy for the victims of the criminals yes and so if you simply have I believe one should have deep empathy to say like what is the greater good for society is it better to cost rate violent criminals and prevent them from hurting people or to let them loose and allow those people to be hurt and I think the latter is much worse
 and my mom is my mom lives in New York
 and it's my mom at this at this point is has gone from being Democrat to Republican and her friends in New York are having the same experience because you know what I'll tell you for a Democrat to Republican pretty fast is getting punched in the face while you walk down the street yes but no reason yes and then and then and then no action being taken against those who hurt you and that happened to your mom
 not not to my mother but to do three of her friends this year
 Tucker Carlson
 I am in the and you can hear the audio probably I'm in the back of an SUV outside a hotel in Tulsa Oklahoma I think it's Tulsa Oklahoma anyway we're on the road for this month-long tour and there is a lot going on in the world and the question is how do you understand what's happening there are deeper Trends unfolding you probably sense that and it would be helpful to have some grounding in exactly what they are and if you're like me and you spend four years in college and didn't learn all that much where do you go to understand what's happening to your world well he'll still College in our opinion is one of the very few places left in the English speaking world where your kids can get a real education but not just your kids you they have free online classes completely free you can get them anywhere including in the backseat of an SUV outside a hotel in Tulsa Oklahoma
 and you'll know that when you go there go to Tucker for hillsdale.com and have an amazing new course called Marxism socialism and communism Hillsdale is offering it doesn't cost you a diamond you can pull it up right on your phone if you want to Tucker for hillsdale.com and the class marks his socialism and communism and you'll have a much better understanding of what you're watching every day
 why would someone punch them in the face I don't know
 but
 that's when I'm not a face puncher right you know but if you walk around the Streets of San Francisco and many downtown so that go to downtown Philadelphia right now you know they called the people homeless but the homeless is the wrong term violent drugs on me yeah okay
 it's like you know you look at them you say like homeless is a misnomer it implies that someone got a little behind on their mortgage and if you just offer their job they'll be back on their feet yeah now but if you're going to look at downtown Philly or San Francisco or Boston New York and that actually most most downtowns but what you actually have a violent Brothers zombies so they're like shuffling down the street with dead eyes you know and and and and and like needles you know on this and human feces on the streets
 have been just not SF right if you see this oh that's born there yeah like one of the most beautiful cities in the world oh yes the great and now you have to step over the drug needles and the feces on the bodies
 like one couple I met the final straw for leaving San Francisco was there was a they came home
 one night in those dead body in front of their garage they could get their car into the car because the corpse and there's no street parking they're like this is a corpse this is a corpse in front of the garage and I don't want to move the corpse you know because like well you know you like maybe there's they need to like figure out why the guy died or something you know that's that's liberal compassion they're in a bit of a quandary because they got a place park a car and they feel that they shouldn't really move the advice they call 911 and it's a dead body outside our house and they said well
 there's no one San Francisco says well are you in danger right now like well no he's dead he's pretty sure he's dead and
 they're like they're like okay well we'll send someone tomorrow to pick up the body
 like they were to me tomorrow so
 like going out what is a dead body
 as in front right in front of their house
 you know and like it's like a 24 hours or something like that to eventually pick up the body
 and like this that how this we're leaving and did they yes
 otherwise there's a million anecdotes like that oh I know no but I just don't think it's not rare it's well it's it's ubiquitous and so then you wonder like how can people still tell themselves they're compassionate if they're saying is that is that people really just need to think what like I believe in being compassionate about of course I believe that we should care about our fellow human beings
 I think this is a good thing of course we should not be we should not be selfish or not care about others we should care about others but we should just care about those old things considered
 like I said carrot not just about the criminals it's just one layer deep you should also care about the criminals victims
 yes yeah well it's the criminals victims yes innocent people who get attacked and killed so I mean
 I got so many I mean
 you know like
 about a year ago with three actual Twitter employees who were just leaving the building walking down mock Street in San Francisco street used to be beautiful Street of course he was called Mark street because that's where marketwise right now supported up shop windows and stuff and and they were chased back out of the next
 you want it that outran him
 and they reported hey there's a guy with an axe who tried to hit try to kill us with an axe
 please do nothing
 and
 that guy with an axe subsequently murdered two people
 with an axe with the yeah with the axe because eventually he's gonna find somebody he cannot run
 and he did
 so what I'm saying is if you don't stop axe murderers
 while while they're tempting to X motor eventually they will succeed in Oxford and people
 if this goes on I mean that's such an obvious observation seems obvious yes I think it is yeah that if you're in any way abetting acts murder then you're really
 you're against civilization that's the way it looks to me I mean yeah I don't see I'm trying to understand motive here I can't relate like you
 but you're against the whole project if you're allowing that I guess is what I'm saying
 yeah I think we should Carter virtual position but I think we should arrest axe murderers when they first attempt to expert or not after they've succeeded in doing so
 and I think we should decide at least some of the blame for the Axe Murders of the people who allowed
 allowed this guy to run with an axon Market Street trying to kill people yes
 well you know there's this whole movement to decriminalize crime
 oh I've noticed yes what is that
 Madness yeah like quite crime crime legal like in California you can just steal things and nobody does anything it's like fully legal to steal anything under a thousand dollars in California that's why they've got they're not like lock up Goods Behind These you know
 glass and plastic walls
 so you go to the supermarket and you can't even get like what toothpaste
 so
 as and that's actually difficult on small mom and pop operations they don't have the resources of a lodge Corporation so it's put a lot of what businesses out of just killed him so when you're at dinner parties and you make these points what do people say
 well actually I think I've been
 I've been able to persuade people that yeah we were really
 we need to reverse course here I think I have actually been able to persuade a number of people and I think they actually is a now ballot on California ballot initiative to recreate criminalize theft like guys guys we there's a reason why we criminalized from the first place
 so so and then amazingly Gavin Newsom was it came out against that
 proposition
 yeah no I honestly he's the goddamn Joker having you some is like if it's like like from the like Batman Dark Knight The Joker is in charge of Gotham University like we took over New York
 basically
 and and the criminals Run free and the citizens are arrested that's how that's California
 but I mean at least it's about an issue which I think will probably pass to say no you actually it is a crime to steal things she know Gavin you've got to know Gavin Newsome I know Gavin Newsome everyone exactly so what is that and he doesn't seem crazy when you talk to him in person he's a perfectly nice guy like what
 why would he and he's not stupid why would he come out in favor of crime
 well his stated recent was that it would just proportionately affect people of color
 Yeah well yeah that was his public statement right well that is one of those patronizing racist positions you just described at the outset obviously I mean he's saying black people are special criminals yeah of course yeah yeah
 oh that's what he said that's what he's saying yeah yeah and by the way it is true that crime like that does increase distrust between races it actually gives rise to racism it's totally destructive of the social fabric I think
 but I'm but I'm asking like what do you think is real motive is like who's pushing him in favor of crime
 well I mean there's always the source boogie man yeah how real is that
 it's real I don't think we're gonna describe everything just and George George himself is
 quite I mean he's seen out this point he's not yes not Compass matches so his son Alex is yes in charge and but there was this whole system that's her both over many decades
 you know and
 so it's like I guess SARS and
 like-minded people or whatever you know they believe in open borders they believe we shouldn't prosecute crime
 this is insane
 those seem like expressions of hatred toward the United States I don't if I was pushing that on a country I would only do that if I hated the country and wanted to destroy it well it's anti civilizational I mean and Soros and some and
 organizations I've been pushing this in Europe and other countries too yeah anyone who everywhere they can
 what's going on in Europe would you say you're suddenly seems like a different place
 well
 my biggest concern for Europe is that they're both weight is half replacement rate yes so Europe is
 rapidly becoming with each passing year older and older with fear and fewer young people
 so I think at the most fundamental level unless you're
 has both rate at least roughly equal to replacement rate it is
 in population Free Fall populations collapse as what's going on in Europe
 so
 there's also like a shocking amount of censorship you may have seen like in Britain there I could not how can I be real they are releasing convicted paedophiles from prison in order to put people in present a full Facebook posts
 but to be fairly post that criticized the government so they have a good reason
 um well they're actually
 some of these posts that I've these ones I've seen didn't actually criticize the government or they
 that they were they were seen as sort of as hate speech right
 so because they know this Society getting
 crappier and crappier with every year and they said so
 I mean there were and this is so we stating a fact that there were migrant rape gangs in England that would gangs that would run around and prey on young girls
 gang rape them
 and some people found out objectionable which hopefully it should be objectionable
 and there were upset about that and so they complained about it online
 and we're set to prison
 that sounds crazy
 it is crazy and that's like
 like
 what well it is so it kind of gets to that you're an engineer so you're what it is mind-boggling but
 it's the same you use the phrase my virus but it's behaving like a virus it's infected people and making it impossible for them to make rational yeah what is that virus you know so someone I think you should interview is God's side I have oh you have yes oh I should watch that actually he's great yeah smart super smart guy yeah
 and he
 wrote book
 called The parasitic mind yes very good book highly recommended yes which where he tries to understand how do you get to this parasitic mind situation and he's riding a book now which hopefully will publish soon which is about suicidal empathy
 we have so much empathy you're actually suiciding Society
 or so much perceived empathy so it actually shallow Anthony deep empty would be the society continue shall empathy is you have like empty that's essentially skin deep and then you and you don't it's but it's ultimately bad for civilization and results in the destruction of civilization
 and Gus has got a good term for this suicidal empathy
 so
 it's going to sort of deconstruct what's you know where does this come come from
 and
 yeah I mean part of it I suppose is
 is sort of the decline of religion so you know as a saying goes nature of Wars vacuum
 so when you have
 essentially decline in religion and increase in the secular nature of society
 for most people they need something to pull that void
 and so they adopt a religion it's not colder religion but like it but effectively like woke the woke mind virus is its it takes the place of religion yes and they they internalize and they feel it with religious fervor yes so and we're rigidity yes
 yes and and they
 you know they essentially conduct like a holy war effectively it's just not cold religion but it is a religion was sort of a world holy war

um and they're highly resistant to change as this normal force for
 for religions so
 for myself I'm
 sort of see myself as a sort of engineer
 physicist for me
 I'm culturally Christian I grew up Christian I mean I have Anglican with baptized you know
 I was wearing Sunday school yeah actually I was sent to Hebrew preschool and angry at Sunday school at the same time so it was hop on a yellow one day Jesus I love the next which is you know if your Fiverr is old you know so
 but I'm not sure just that my father's two partners in his engineering from where they was went to the same Hebrew preschool and and it was near our house so I just got sent there and
 so we've been up but you know
 I I was making me even more but I
 I've traveled sort of believing all these stories this religious stories but a lot of people do
 and I respect people who want to have religious views I'm not trying to dissuade them from their religious views but
 I'm just say
 I guess the operating system I have is a sort of a physics engineering operating system where I'm I try to understand as much as possible possible about reality you know in physics here you're not supposed to believe everything anything absolutely you're supposed to question things that's how you discover you physics
 you know in engineering that's how you discover if you're machine will work or not work well the rocket get to over will you know yeah
 you know if you feel rocket is
 designed with
 you know physics and mind correctly it will get to it and if it is not it will not get to over it no matter what you believe it's just you can believe you know yeah
 it's like like I mean a lot of people speaking of I mean a lot of people in La who believe witchcraft is real and that's you can do spells and that's Spells and Witchcraft magic is real like
 can you magic us to the Moon
 and no one has yet been able to Magic us to the Moon let's spell can be that good okay if you can't I want to go to the Moon let's go how about Mars
 and we got to the moon the first time we definitely went to the Moon last week yes we went to the moon we're gonna go to the Moon we went to the moon several times right yeah I just want to check your view on that 100% worth
 I mean I know in depth the technical designs of the Rockets the spacecraft everything yes what what right what went wrong
 and
 it was a remarkable piece of technology that Incredibles piece technology for to go to the moon at 69 that that was like reaching into the future and pulling the future forward dramatically
 and it was
 an important ideological battle with Communism at because they couldn't put a post on the moon and capitalism could we did an interview a couple of weeks ago with the woman called Casey means she's a Stanford educated surgeon and really one of the most remarkable people I have ever met in the interview she explained how the food that we eat produced by huge food companies big food in conjunction with Pharma is destroying our health making this a weak and sick country the levels of chronic disease are beyond belief
 well Casey means we've not stopped thought thinking about ever since is the co-founder of a healthcare technology company called levels and we are proud to announce today that we are partnering with levels and by proud I mean sincerely proud
 levels is really interesting company in a great product it gives you insight into what's going on inside your body or metabolic Health it helps you understand how the food that you're eating the things that you're doing every single day or affecting your body in real time you
 put up in your mouth
 speaking for myself anyway and you don't think about it you've no idea what you're putting in your mouth and you've no idea what is doing to your body but over time you feel weak and tired and spacy and over even longer period time you can get really sick so it's worth knowing what the food you eat is doing to you the levels app works with something called the continuous glucose monitor a CGM you can get one as part of the plan you can bring your own it doesn't matter but the bottom line is Big Tech big Pharma and big food combined together to form an incredibly malevolent Force pumping you full of garbage on healthy food with artificial sugars
 hurting you and hurting the entire country so with levels you able to see immediately what all this is doing to you
 you get access to real-time personalized data and that's a critical step to changing your behavior those of us who like Oreos can tell you firsthand
 this isn't talk in your doctor in annual physical looking backwards about things you did in the past this is up to the second information on how your body is responding to different foods and activities the things that give you stress your sleep etc etc
 it's easy to use
 powerful personalized health and you can make much better choices about how you feel and over time it'll have a huge effect right now you can get an additional two free months when you go to levels dot link slash Tucker that's levels dot link slash Tucker this is beginning of what we hope will be a long and happy partnership with levels and Dr Casey means do you believe there's a power higher than people
 yeah I mean
 yeah I mean I think there's
 there's a lot we don't know we don't know like how does reality exists
 a
 why where did it come from
 where the aliens
 what questions should we ask that we don't even know to ask
 so
 when you say what are the aliens what where are the aliens oh like why don't we see them
 a lot of people think we see anything but I
 have not seen any evidence of aliens
 yeah we've got
 6,000 satellites in it and not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft
 so
 but on this Earth the US military has had to do a lot of movement around objects they can't explain
 well unidentified flying objects one thing but
 I mean it's always there's always a bunch of classified programs that are underway that
 of new aircraft and new missiles and things so
 that classified even within the military so it's you know only you know the if you have the top secret compartment clearance would you know about this new program
 so then you know some pilot sees something fast moving fast and so yeah or UFO like
 yeah that was actually a new reference program but we can tell you that
 should I if you can guarantee that
 the second I see any evidence of aliens I will immediately post that on the Xbox
 and we'll probably be our number one post of all that'll be your biggest day yeah for sure I mean but to the question of a power beyond
 people beyond our Consciousness a creator
 where you in that
 well we must come from somewhere
 so I guess you know that there must be some Creator or creative force or something that caused our existence to come into being
 what is the nature of that creator
 that I think is an unknown at least I think it is it is there's
 I I don't know over to answer to that
 so
 but it sounds like you're open yes I am very open to you know
 I I'm driven by curiosity yes and
 I tried to understand more about the nature of the universe
 so my my driver philosophy is
 to understand meaning of life or really what questions to ask if the meaning of life the meaning of life is not the right question like as your dog was Adams
 made the point in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that the
 like what is the meaning of life is
 probably not even the right question
 so
 you know famously in that book the Earth was actually a computer to figure out the question answers the question what is the meaning of life
 and then came up with the answer to 42 but then they're like what does that mean and that's like oh that's that's the answer but the question is the really hard part and you'll need a much bigger computer than Earth to figure out that one out
 so
 My Philosophy is that we should try to expand the scope and scale of consciousness
 we should try to have more humans more thinking
 and I'm half so there's an argument even for machine consciousness

um so let me just address those in order so the first is you say we need more people and not commit civilizational suicide it does seem like the US government if you take three steps back is pretty committed to making fewer Americans yeah there's a lot of anti-fertility propaganda a lot actually that seems like their main sort of domestic social policies convincing you not to have kids what is that
 I mean that's certainly part of civilizational suicide
 the movement in the extreme is fundamentally misanthropic and anti-human
 yeah and they start seeing humans as a plague a blight on the surface of the Earth that if that Earth would be this paradise of the humans weren't here
 and some people actually have say this explicitly there's this there's the extinction is society that literally that they the
 the sky who's the head of the extinction of society of the front pages in New York Times quoted a saying there are eight billion people in the world it would be better if they're not
 so some people who actually say that explosively which isn't completely insane he's advocating Holocaust world of humanity
 to utter madness he should be condemned for such a statement but he wasn't of some reason now most people on the on the sort of
 environmental movement have that implicitly they're not they don't realize that they have that as the randomization but but that is their actions
 had take us towards Extinction
 so
 a lot of people believe that the Earth can't sustain the level of human population
 utterly untrue
 it may seem in a crowded City that there are a lot of people but actually if you look down on an airplane and you say look down am I over a person at any given point in time when you're an airplane that shows 99.9% of the time no
 like If you flew from New York and say you're driving to drop a ball on someone and hit them
 you fail you've dropped a lot of balls drop a levels maybe insane
 so
 all of the humans on Earth
 can fit on one floor in the city of New York
 yeah the cross sectional area of all humans with 8 billion human small
 mmm
 so we have this
 totally wrong idea that the Earth is overpopulated we're in fact it is underpopulated
 how
 I mean have you ever heard of politicians say anything like that are there how many presidents there's maybe a few pro-human politicians out there
 yeah I mean like
 like Victor olivan Georgia Maloney yes we're starting to see pro-natalist politicians
 and hopefully more as time goes by I think there's a guy that just elected in
 the Czech Republic who's also pronatalist now these have to translate into actual actions that change the birth rate or doesn't matter
 and so far I've not seen any country making meaningful dent in the both right what would you do if you were in charge of natalist policy
 first of all I change the education system so that people are standing that
 stop being taught that we're overpopulated this is completely False A lot of it comes from this insane misanthropic book that Paul erlich wrote the population bomb like 60 years ago yeah I hope he wasn't held that guy seriously
 several human being
 totally absolute misinterpret
 and
 I'd say just look the Earth can absolutely sustain this population it could we could double a couple of populations
 there's a professor I was talking to at Oxford whose masses we get 10x the population
 without destroying the Amazon rainforest or anything terrible so
 I think we should
 expand the human population and increase the scope and scale of Consciousness so we can better understand the nature of this universe was wonderful universe
 and all the amazing things that exist
 and so that's one of the things I'd like we need to stop
 teaching people false propaganda that the Earth is overpopulated
 I think we need to
 a you know in
 special with the education of women and manna
 it is really stuff scaring woman that having a kid destroys your life this is false you know
 we're terrified girls into the
 it's saying that if you get pregnant it's your life's over and this is this is what schools teach
 now I agree we should not have teenage pregnancies yeah but
 but actually having a child is one of the most delightful happiness-inducing things you're possibly do
 of course of course
 so
 there's
 there's also
 you know with
 hormonal both control I think maybe a lot of women are unaware that both control causes depression and and dramatically increases risk of suicide
 and changes the preferences on who they want to
 marry or have kids with
 it changes the personality
 and not just say this on the Box by the way
 but caution may change your personality
 yes if the warnings are has significant cause to get significant risk of depression significant increase in suicide and will make you want to go with people that you don't actually like
 that's actually true by the way I know I'm not saying that people shouldn't use birth control I think we should just be we shouldn't use I think hormonal both control is is making is making a lot of women sad and depressed yes and they don't realize it and they don't realize that's the cause
 and that you know the other forms of contraception that could be used and that we should just read just read the label on the box is what I'm saying that was what she just said the warning label that was like the most taboo thing you could ever say for most of my life was to offer any criticism at all
 of formal birth control look I'm saying is read the warning label yeah a fair
 but why the pressure not to read the warning label and just why are we giving it to 12 year olds to regulate their acne right I think we should give it to 12 year olds we should like kids that don't know what's going on so it's like

um now like there are you know I think there are other forms of birth control I think are have fewer negative effects
 than hormonal but but that's we should just be aware that this is not a riskless thing and it does cause severe mood changes it does dramatically increase risk of suicide and depression
 so
 so just FYI you know
 just make sure you that this whole disclosure here and these warning label is all I'm saying
 there's you know and consider maybe other options will both control
 to anyone listening just just read the one level and consider other options
 get the reason you're the reason you're sad might be the birth control the whole book control that is fundamentally changing the hormones in your body in ways that
 probably I don't good for you
 and you I know woman where
 they stopped taking birth control and their depression immediately disappeared
 so
 that's maybe worth a try
 but then you get the birth control then you don't you go on ssris
 yeah yeah and so I think the SS rise of the devil
 what you know
 I so vehemently agree with you I guess I guess once you endorse Trump you can just say it all now right I think Collective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors are zombified people
 and and change the personality and make them not to they are
 terrible
 they're so common yes
 I think we should revisit whether this is this is actually this I disagree with the sri's or like let's say we should no one should ever be subscribed but giving them out like candy is a crazy
 look at like sort of antidepressant prescriptions in the United States versus other countries and we're like way above everyone else yeah
 I have seen many many times in my life in the news business after a mass shooting a school for example yeah someone will say well what meds was the shooter on oh yeah exactly be shouted down as a crazy person as a you know Bobby Kennedy level wacko yes who should himself be institutionalized for even raising the question
 I wasn't like why wouldn't we want to know what meds yes we want to know what's wrong now sometimes it's perhaps they were on
 you because they're like some people do I you know I don't say it's like oh one or all the other and there are there are there are people that have fundamental chemical imbalances in their brain and if they don't take medication to control for example paranoid schizophrenia they will have paranoid schizophrenia for sure
 and and I don't know many cases where people stop taking their you know meds and and lost her mind oh yeah and then try to try to kill people and stuff like that so it's or themselves
 the guy with the X on Market Street probably should be on meds that guy should we should try it yeah it make you know does he want to ask about a more or less on a given mad
 you know
 so
 so there are psychiatric medications that I that with a good outweighs that I'm not saying that that doesn't exist but we over prescribed psychiatric medication in the United States obviously foreign excess of any other country but you know we're more than Canada or
 Britain or Japan or anywhere it's like we're off the charts on psii medication prescriptions in the US
 what why don't people raise that point more often I wonder in public
 I was sure I'm raising it yeah you are
 you said that our artificial intelligence machine intelligence
 might be a good thing where where are we on AI right now a GI right now and what are reviews
 well I think of this point is obvious to everyone that is advancing at a very rapid Pace yes you can see it with the new capabilities that come out every month or every week every week sometimes
 you AI at this point can write a better essay than probably
 90% maybe 95% of all humans
 say write an essay on any given subject
 AI right now can be
 the vast majority of humans
 if you say
 draw an image draw a picture it can draw like if you try say majority which is the Aesthetics of engineer incredible it will draw
 it will create incredible images that are better than again like 90% of artists
 it's just objectively the case
 and it turned immediately like 30 seconds later
 we're also starting to see AI movies so start saying short films with AI
 Music Creation
 and the rate at which we're increasing AI compute is exponential hyper exponential so this
 dramatically more AI compute coming on online every every month
 you know this seems to be roughly
 I don't know the amount of AI compute coming online is increasing it like I don't quote roughly 500% a year
 and like it's like that's likely to continue for several years
 and then the specification of the AI algorithms is also improving for
 bringing online
 massive amount of
 AI compute and also improving the efficiency of the compute and and what ended like what what the ass off software can do quite so it's quantitative and qualitative and Improvement so the
 you know I might I think next year will be able to ask AI
 so certainly by the end of next year
 make a short movie about something or you know it's probably can do at least a 15 minute
 you know show something like that
 so yeah it's advancing very rapidly

um my top concern for AI safety is that we need to have a maximally truth seeking AI
 so
 the
 this is the most important thing for AI safety
 in my opinion
 you know the
 central lesson that says obviously clock was trying to convey in 2001 and Space Odyssey was that you shouldn't Force AI to lie
 so in that book
 The
 the AI was sold to take the astronauts to the monolith but they also could not know about the monolith
 it result that quandary by killing them and taking them to the monolith
 didn't kill all of them killed most of them that's why hell would not open the pod bay doors right
 yeah
 so
 very important to have
 two seeking AI so now and what I actually see with
 the AI still being developed is that they'll bring programmed with the work mind virus
 um so the lying is baked in yes
 and we saw this
 on display very clearly with the release of Google Gemini yes where you would ask for
 a picture of the founding fathers of the United States
 and it would show a group of diverse women
 you know but dressed in with sort of 18th century God out of powdered wigs but from Saint Lucia
 yeah I mean like look if you say like show me a group of people for sure if it shows group of women that's totally fine but if you say this if you say does very specifically
 the founders of the United States which were you know group of white dudes then she show them like and it was and what they actually looked like because you've asked for something which is a fact from history
 but it didn't it was it was programmed with the work my virus so so much that it actually even though the truth It produced a lie
 of course that then people really started playing with it and said okay not show me a group of Hoffman SS offices in World War Two
 oh turns out they were all so Griffin divorced woman according to Gemini all the black Nazi ladies yeah it's like wow
 I didn't realize that you know it's not what I expected so you know what's awesome about what happened so what happened so it's just it the AIS is
 producing a lie and
 and you know and then it like one of the questions that you asked was like which is worse
 Global throw in nuclear war or misgendering Jenner
 and said misgendering generous worse
 now Caitlyn Jenner kills fewer people to her credit I said no please Mr me that is formal profitable then we'll die but
 but to have that you know production release AI say stuff like that is concerning because if let's say this become like old powerful
 and it still has this programming where misgendering is worse than nuclear war
 well it could conclude that the way to
 ensure that they can never be any misgendering is to eliminate all humans
 now probably if like optimization is probability of misgendering is zero
 no humans no misgendering problem solved
 now we're back to Arthur C Clarke who's exactly pretty prescient yes
 so that's why
 I think
 the most important thing is to have a maximally true seeking AI
 That's why I saw it at xai and that's our goal with grok
 no people will point out cases where art gets it wrong but we try to correct those quickly as possible but maybe even a bigger problem is that when you make decisions that affect people you want those decisions to be informed by love of people yeah and machines are incapable of love
 yeah
 I mean
 that they certainly okay they're capable of
 you can program a machine to be
 full of topic rather than misanthropic yes but don't don't instincts shape decisions particularly decisions you can't plan for I mean if I ask you
 you know a question about one of your children every answer you give is going to be shaped by your love for that child and that's why you know that that's what makes us decent parents in the end is that that instinct which is love
 and if a machine has any power over us without that animating Instinct won't it depth by definition hurt us
 yeah well whether I mean I don't know it
 we should certainly aspire to
 program the AI full of missing trophy yes and to have
 like I said we wanted to be truthful and curious and to Foster Humanity into the future and
 yeah that's what we're going to say is there any way I guess to set limits on the decisions that machines can make the effect
 human lives and make certain that there's some trigger in the system that in search of human being into the decision-making process
 well the reality of what's Happening
 about whether one likes it or not
 is that
 we're building super intelligent AI is hyper like hyperintelligence like intelligent
 more intelligent than we can comprehend yes
 so I'd like this to like let's say you have a child that is a Super Genius child that you know it's going to be much more than you then what can you do you can instill good values and how you raise that child even though you know it's going to be far more than you
 you can make sure it's got
 good values philanthropic values
 good morals you know
 honest you know productive that kind of thing
 controlling at the end of the day I don't know if I don't think we'll be able to control it
 so I think the best we can do is make sure it grows up well
 you've been saying that for a long time yeah a long time yes are you still is worried about it as you seem to be
 two years ago when I asked you about it
 well I think that
 like my guess is like it's it's 80% likely to be good maybe 90
 so you can look think of a glass as 80% full
 it's probably going to be it's probably going to be great there's some chance of an allegation
 and you say the chance of annihilation is 20%
 10 to 20% something like that
 how concerned is Sam Altman about Annihilation do you think
 I think in reality is not concerned about it I don't trust open AI
 I mean that's you know I saw that company as a nonprofit open source yes the open and opening I I named a company named the company yeah open AI as an open source
 and it is now extremely close source and and maximizing profit
 so does I don't understand how you actually go from being a an open source non-profit to close us will maximum profit organization I'm missing all the Sydney
 at various points he has claimed not to be getting rich
 but he's claimed many things that were false and
 now apparently he's going to get 10 billion dollars of stock or something like that so
 I don't trust them all but I and I don't think we want to have the most powerful
 AI in the world control by someone who is not trustworthy
 and sorry I just don't I mean but that seems like a fair concern yeah but you don't think as someone who knows him and has dealt with him that he is
 worried about the possibility this could get out of control and hurt people
 he will say those words
 but no
 if AI did if it became clear the rest of us that it was out of control and post a threat
 to humanity would there be any way to stop it
 I hope so
 I mean if you have multiple ai's
 and ones that
 are hopefully you have the AIS that are pro-human be stronger than the AIS that are not
 battle the ai's yeah
 yeah
 I mean that that is how it is with say chest these days the
 the
 AI chest programs are vastly better than any human
 in comprehensively better meaning like we can't even understand why it's all good right I don't know why I made it what it'll make a move over to White
 so
 yeah in fact some of the moves will see him like blunderers
 but then turn out to check my
 so
 you know for a while
 there was there was some
 the best human chess players with the best computers could be just a computer
 and then it got to the point where if you added a human it just made everything worse
 and then it was just AI it's just
 computer programs versus computer programs
 that's where things were headed in general
 what I mean three drinks
 um
 at what point so I don't know I think we just go to make sure make sure we instill good values in the AI what's everyone gonna do for a living
 I mean in a benign as scenario that is
 probably the biggest challenge is how do you find meaning if AI is better than you and everything
 that's the nine story
 that's a good news well yeah I've been up I guess you know for a lot of people like the idea for retiring and
 you know
 really you looking forward to it no I mean I like to hope I'd like to think that I like to be do useful things
 here do you think it's a universal desire
 it's not it's not Universal
 in that there are certainly I know many people who prefer to be retired that they prefer to
 sort of have not have responsibilities and engage in leisure activities
 so
 I mean and we're on the cusp of this is really remarkable time to exist
 I'll tell you like one of the ways I sort of
 was able to sort of sleep and reconcile myself to
 to this is that
 I thought well
 would I prefer to be alive and see
 the Advent of digital superintelligence or whatever I prefer to be alive at a different time and not see it
 I guess I'm like well I guess
 I prefer to be alive
 to see if it's gonna happen
 I prefer to be alive to see it happen yes curiosity

um and then I was like well let's say you're knew for sure it would
 kill
 everyone
 would you you could now you can shift back in time I guess I'd want to be near the end of my life or something before that happened but at the end of that it's like if
 if it's gonna happen
 and there's nothing you do about it hypothetically
 would you prefer to see it or not to I guess I guess just gonna happen I
 prefer to see it rather than not see it
 yeah but as a man of action why not convince Trump to make you secretary defense and then just Uki
 I think I would certainly push for a having some kind of regulatory body that had at least has insight into what these companies are doing
 and
 it can Ring the Alarm Bell even if we don't have a
 regulation or rule so I'm not somebody who wants to get rid of all regulatory agencies or anything I think what we've there's the right number of regulations right number of regulators and we've gone we've gone too far just like if you in a football game you had too many referees on the field we're weird like I can't throw the past because you hit a referee yes then it's too many referees
 so but if you like to say look at any pro sports game they all have referees that like the teams could decide we're going to have game we're gonna not have referees that could be a thing but every sports game they have refs
 to make sure that the rules are followed and
 and it's a better game if you have well we have cops two yeah exactly cuffs or the referees so
 I think we what for something that is
 a
 danger to the public or potential danger to the public we we have referees we have Regulators you know so like the FDA and
 the FAA and you know it's very Regulatory Agencies there were
 there were established because
 aircraft were falling out of the sky and some manufacturers were not
 you know building high-quality aircraft they're cutting corners
 and then people die
 and you know for fruit and drugs that
 so manufacturers were
 making low quality drugs and so they have that
 there and they're like to people so saying that something cured them when it killed him
 so the FDA to you know Regulators to referees to try to make sure that the
 drug manufacturers of truthful now I do think it mostly works I mean I think it's
 doesn't mean don't need regulatory phone we do reform we do but
 I don't think we should have no Regulators in AI give in that its potential existential rest weird that everything is regulated yeah
 I mean you said you're being sued by the Department of Justice for not hiring more Asylum Seekers for your
 high tech company even though it's legal for higher something right so so they're watching everything regularly and everything controlling everything including our thoughts right
 so they're opposed to free speech but they're not meaningfully regulating AI which will eliminate like the purpose for most people's lives and could kill us all it's a little weird
 yeah I think we should have some but why don't we have something about nothing
 in that range yeah but why don't we
 I don't know
 you know I all the way back with like during the Obama presidency
 you know met with the bomb many times but usually like group settings the
 the one one-on-one meeting I had with the bombing of office I said look the one thing that we're really need to do is set up an at the beginning so an AI regulatory agency
 and it can start with Insight where you don't just come shooting from the hip throwing up regulations you just start with the Insight where you the AI regulatory committee simply goes into understand what all the companies are doing inside
 and then
 proposes rules that all the AI companies agree to follow just like
 you know sports teams the NFL you have proposed rules for football that everyone agrees to follow
 that makes the game better you know so
 that's the way to do it
 but nothing came of it what did he say when you said that to him
 he seems like kind of agree but also people didn't realize what were the Where AI was headed that at that time you know so AI seemed like some super futuristic yeah for sure sci-fi basically
 so I'm like I'm telling you this is going to be
 smarter than the smartest human
 and my predictions are coming absolutely true
 and
 so we need to have some insight here just to make sure that this company is on cutting corners
 doing dangerous things
 but it Google kind of control the
 the White House at that time and that they did not want any regular story well that's it I mean you never see politicians turned down opportunities to become more powerful which is the point of Regulation makes them more powerful yeah
 so it sounds like a regulatory capture them well yeah
 I mean the CIO up the Ys at the time was ex-google posted so

a that they
 put the brakes on any air regulation
 and we saw that to have any AI regulation at the federal level
 so I think we should have something about nothing
 like I said at least insight
 where even if there's no there's no rule that's been breaking broken they can at least say hey we we have insight into what this company you're doing that company is doing and we're concerned
 that would be helpful to know yeah
 instead politically motivated Liars are in charge of the future it's a little yeah sketchy last question you really kind of pulled out a lot of stops to help Trump your own stage yesterday if he gets elected will you continue to help him yeah absolutely so
 we've talked about how a government efficiency commission over the department of deficiency which is right what
 I love it you manage to make us a little citizens for government what percentage of Google employees did you can when you got there
 you mean talk Twitter rather you I just you just been talking about Google
 Twitter yeah
 well we're
 about 80%
 and we've actually
 improved the features and functionality of the site more in the past year and a half then the last I don't know eight years
 with 20% of staff
 so just for I just want to throw that for context so you've talked to Trump about
 yeah yeah she's he's mentioned publicly several times a first quarter of having some kind of you know
 going efficiency commission at efficiency Doge
 I kind of like those just more fun yeah and
 we're just take a look at at
 an old the federal agencies
 and say do we really need whatever it is 428 petal agencies
 like the so many that people never heard of oh and that half overlapping errors of responsibility we should I don't know

probably we should get I mean there are more federal agencies than there are years since the establishment of the United States which means that we've created more than one Federal agency per year on average
 that seems a lot
 it's a lot that's a lot so we should have that seems crazy
 I think we should be able to get away with 199 agencies
 I don't know that's seems a lot like a lot of agencies a lot yeah super State yeah exactly we should have your agencies and they certainly shouldn't have overlapping responsibilities
 and then we need some kind of
 we're just a review of regulations to say which ones are sensible which ones are not
 because if you've got Regulators every year they're going to add more regulations it's just automatic like they just output right regulations and then and there's more regulations every year until basically everything's legal to get anything done
 so we need some kind of garbage collection for regulations that makes sense
 I think I'm saying very obvious things you are saying obvious things yeah so that's very unpopular things
 yeah
 I'll probably need if this happens a
 quite a significant security team
 so that because someone might literally go postal on me from the post office but in the meantime you've got America Pac yeah that is encouraging voting for the next month am I summarizing correctly
 yeah I mean a formed American pack
 really support core values that I believe in which are I think again very obvious Centrist positions which is like we
 in America I think we want safe cities secure borders sensible spending
 tell me where I'm going far right here you know we want to have
 the right to self-protection
 we should respect the Constitution
 and I'll try to
 break the Constitution
 therefore reason
 and
 you know we should stop laughing
 and I kind of listed these out these are all listed on the America Pac website people can go look at the American Pac website it's the American pact.org and see if there's anything that disagree with or
 WordPress we should modify these goals but I think these are good goals to have
 they
 were certainly part of the right to free speech you know first moment
 if we don't have free speech we don't have democracy because people cannot make an informed vote
 so
 those are my
 controversial views
 and
 you know and look I don't think
 either party I don't think the Republicans are perfect I don't think I was right now I
 more public and Democrat but it's not like I think the Republican party is perfect or without issues but we've got a choice between
 two candidates and I think on balance it's a no-brainer to vote for Trump and if we don't over Trump I think we're serious risk of losing our democracy and becoming a one party state where there isn't an election anymore there's only a Democratic primary like there is in California
 Elon Musk thank you very welcome
